# LemonadeStand

C# port of the old Apple II Lemonade Stand game from original 1979 Applesoft BASIC source @ http://codenautics.com/lemonade/

First stage is a direct port from BASIC => C#. Original BASIC is in the comments.

Later some refactoring and updating to modern patterns will be done.

for reference, here is the [Apple II BASIC manual](https://ia801707.us.archive.org/11/items/Apple_II_Basic_Programming_Manual_1978_Apple/Apple_II_Basic_Programming_Manual_1978_Apple.pdf) 
(for some reason, the only definition it gives for RND(-1) is "try it and see")
